  <p>These are the three parts of this lab</p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <h1>Part 1: Github Pages</h1>
  <p>In the first part of this lab, I created the Github Repository, which included the html, css and the sub directories</p>
  <h1>Part 2: Jekyll and Github Pages</h1>
  <p>Jekyll is a static site generator, which automatically re-generates all the html pages for the website each time you commit. In the second part, we set up Jekyll</p>
  <h1>Part 3: Blog</h1>
  <p>In the final part of the lab, I created a new layout for folders, blog and posts to be able to store individual posts. This lab was done using CSS, HTML and Markdown</p> </body>
